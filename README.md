## 3.1 Operational Amplifier(Op-amp)
### 3.1.1 Introduction
An operational amplifier is basically a high gain,direct coupled amplifier. It has two inputs 
and an one output, but generally it is operated in single ended input-single ended
output mode. The differential amplifier forms the first stage of an op-amp. Opamp can
perform several arithmetic operations like addition, subtraction, differentiation, integration,
comparison, analog to digital conversion etc. Opamp are used is analog computers.

IC 741 is widely used Op-amp. In this IC when input is zero, the output can be adjusted
to zero by varying the 10K potentiometer between offset null terminal.


### 3.1.2 Block diagram and inputs
An opamp has two input terminals:
1. Non-inverting input: output signal is in phase with input signal, denoted by (+).
2. Inverting input: output signal is out of phase with input signal, denoted by (-).
