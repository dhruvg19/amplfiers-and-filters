# Section 3: AMPLIFIERS
## 3.1 Operational Amplifier(Op-amp)
### 3.1.1 Introduction
An operational amplifier is basically a high gain,direct coupled amplifier. It has two inputs 
and an one output, but generally it is operated in single ended input-single ended
output mode. The differential amplifier forms the first stage of an op-amp. Opamp can
perform several arithmetic operations like addition, subtraction, differentiation, integration,
comparison, analog to digital conversion etc. Opamp are used is analog computers.

IC 741 is widely used Op-amp. In this IC when input is zero, the output can be adjusted
to zero by varying the 10K potentiometer between offset null terminal.

An opamp has two input terminals:
1. Non-inverting input: output signal is in phase with input signal, denoted by (+).
2. Inverting input: output signal is out of phase with input signal, denoted by (-).

# SECTION 4: ACTIVE AND PASSICE FILTERS
The filter is a circuit which changes amplitude and phase of the input signal and produces
output accordingly. It filters or eliminates some frequencies and passes some
frequencies. Hence it provides different attenuation to different frequencies. Based on
components used in the construction of the filter there are two types of filters i.e active
filter and passive filter.

**Four major types of Filters**

The four primary types of filters include the low-pass filter, the high-pass filter, the
band-pass filter, and the notch filter (or the band-reject or band-stop filter). Note: A
notch filter is a bandstop filter with a narrow bandstop bandwidth. Notch filters are
used to attenuate a narrow range of frequencies.

 ## 4.1 Low Pass Filter
 Allows low-frequency signals and difficult passage to high-frequency signals.
 
• Inductive Low-Pass Filter

• Capacitive Low-Pass Filter
